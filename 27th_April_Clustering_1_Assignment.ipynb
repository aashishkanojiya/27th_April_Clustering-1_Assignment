        "Clustering algorithms are a type of unsupervised machine learning algorithm that group similar data points together into clusters based on their similarity. There are several different types of clustering algorithms, which can be broadly categorized into the following categories based on their approach and underlying assumptions:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.Hierarchical clustering: Hierarchical clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that creates a hierarchy of clusters by recursively partitioning the data into smaller clusters. There are two types of hierarchical clustering: agglomerative and divisive. Agglomerative clustering starts with each data point in its own cluster and then recursively merges clusters based on their similarity, while divisive clustering starts with all data points in one cluster and then recursively splits clusters based on their dissimilarity.\n",

        "2.Partitioning clustering: Partitioning clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that divides the data into a predetermined number of clusters. The most popular partitioning clustering algorithm is k-means clustering, which works by randomly selecting k initial cluster centroids, assigning each data point to the nearest centroid, and then moving the centroids to minimize the sum of squared distances between data points and their assigned centroid.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.Density-based clustering: Density-based clustering is a type of clustering algorithm that groups together data points that are close to each other in terms of density. The most popular density-based clustering algorithm is DBSCAN, which works by finding areas of high density and grouping together data points that are within a certain distance of each other.\n",
